# Code of Conduct

## Purpose
This project is part of publicly funded scientific research.  
We aim to build a community that values **honesty, openness, reproducibility, and collaboration**.  
Our shared goal is to generate sustainable insights into the physics of trapped ions and weak collisions by working together transparently.

## Our Standards

### Expected behavior
- Communicate respectfully and constructively.
- Critique ideas, methods, and results â€” never people.
- Uphold honesty and scientific integrity in all contributions.
- Share code, data, and analysis steps as openly and reproducibly as possible.
- Acknowledge the work of others and give credit appropriately.
- Support an inclusive environment for contributors of all backgrounds and career stages.

### Unacceptable behavior
- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Misrepresentation or misuse of data, code, or results.
- Withholding critical methodological details that would block reproducibility.
- Violating licensing terms (GPLv3) or misusing contributed data.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all interactions in this repository, including issues, pull requests, discussions, and related communication channels.

## Enforcement
Maintainers (starting with **Ulrich Warring, University of Freiburg**) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct.  
Violations may result in warnings or removal from the project community, depending on severity.  
Concerns can be raised confidentially via direct contact with the maintainer.

## Scientific Responsibility
Because this is publicly funded research, we carry a **special responsibility**:  
- to pursue knowledge honestly,  
- to make results reproducible and verifiable,  
- and to share methods and findings as openly as possible for the benefit of the broader community.  

By contributing, you agree to uphold these principles of **open, honest, and sustainable science**.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct adapts elements of the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and emphasizes values specific to open scientific research.
