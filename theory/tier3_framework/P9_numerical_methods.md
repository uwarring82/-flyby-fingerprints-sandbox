# Pillar 9: Numerical Methods & Computational Validation

**Scope**  
This pillar documents the computational techniques required to simulate ion dynamics, collisions, and detection signals. It specifies molecular dynamics (MD), symplectic integrators, Monte Carlo collision sampling, and hybrid quantum-classical solvers, emphasizing accuracy, stability, and reproducibility.  
The pillar defines the validation workflow connecting theory-derived models to numerics and experimental cross-checks.

**Inputs**  
- Physical models, rates, and parameters from [Pillars 1â€“8](../_glossary.md) via referenced outputs  
- Benchmark scenarios and acceptance metrics defined by upstream pillars  
- Software engineering standards from the numerics track  

**Outputs**  
- Recommended algorithms, timestep constraints, and convergence criteria for each modeling regime  
- Reference implementations or pseudocode for key solvers and coupling schemes  
- Validation plans comparing simulations with analytic results and experimental data  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- [ ] Document algorithm selection guidelines for MD, symplectic, and Monte Carlo approaches  
- [ ] Provide convergence and stability tests tied to upstream acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Define data formats and interfaces for exchanging results with numerics and experiments  
- [ ] Establish reproducibility checklist including seeding, versioning, and benchmarking requirements  
- [ ] Add glossary entries for numerical tolerances and convergence metrics  

**Validation Script**  
- File: `theory/validation/P9_numerics_validation.py`  
- Purpose: Execute reference simulations and compare against analytic baselines from earlier pillars  

**Notes & References**  
- Leverage [`_glossary.md`](../_glossary.md) to align algorithm terminology with physics definitions.  
- Cite computational physics and trapped-ion simulation references listed in [`_references.bib`](../_references.bib).
