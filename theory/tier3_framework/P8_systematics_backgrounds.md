# Pillar 8: Experimental Systematics & Backgrounds

**Scope**  
This pillar catalogs technical noise sources and systematic effects that perturb trapped-ion dynamics or mask collision signatures. It covers electric- and magnetic-field noise, laser intensity/frequency fluctuations, detection electronics, and vacuum-related drifts.  
Outputs provide mitigation strategies, calibration plans, and residual uncertainty budgets that experiments must track.

**Inputs**  
- Trap operating points and mode sensitivities from [Pillars 1](../tier1_foundations/P1_single_ion_dynamics.md) and [3](../tier2_system_dynamics/P3_collective_modes.md)  
- Heating and decoherence models from [Pillars 4](../tier2_system_dynamics/P4_statistical_mechanics.md) and [6](P6_open_quantum_systems.md)  
- Detector and laser specifications from experimental design notes  

**Outputs**  
- Comprehensive noise budget tables with frequency- and mode-dependent couplings  
- Calibration protocols and monitoring procedures for key systematics  
- Residual uncertainty estimates propagated to detection metrics  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- [ ] Enumerate dominant electric, magnetic, and laser noise channels with scaling laws  
- [ ] Provide calibration and monitoring checklists for each subsystem  
- [ ] Quantify impact of systematics on heating and coherence benchmarks  
- [ ] Recommend mitigation strategies prioritized by feasibility and payoff  
- [ ] Update glossary entries for noise spectral densities and systematic budgets  

**Validation Script**  
- File: `theory/validation/P8_systematics_budget.py`  
- Purpose: Aggregate noise spectra, propagate to heating/coherence metrics, and flag outliers  

**Notes & References**  
- See [`_glossary.md`](../_glossary.md) for noise-budget terminology.
