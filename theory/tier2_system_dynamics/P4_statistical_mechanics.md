# Pillar 4: Statistical Mechanics of Collisions

**Scope**  
This pillar bridges single-collision physics to ensemble-level heating and cooling dynamics. It formulates rate equations, Fokkerâ€“Planck descriptions, and stochastic models that capture how repeated interactions shape motional energy and temperature evolution.  
Outputs set the canonical heating-rate benchmarks and uncertainty budgets required by experiments and numerics.

**Inputs**  
- Collision kernels and cross sections from [Pillar 2](../tier1_foundations/P2_collision_fundamentals.md)  
- Mode structures and participation factors from [Pillar 3](P3_collective_modes.md)  
- Environmental parameters: background gas density, trap drive noise, and cooling rates  

**Outputs**  
- Closed-form and numerical models for temperature evolution T(t) and energy diffusion  
- Mode-resolved heating rates and cross-talk matrices  
- Criteria for steady-state temperatures under various cooling strategies  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- [ ] Derive rate-equation models linking Langevin rates to T(t)  
- [ ] Validate diffusion coefficients against Monte Carlo simulations  
- [ ] Provide uncertainty propagation for density and cross-section inputs  
- [ ] Tabulate mode-resolved heating budgets for representative traps  
- [ ] Add glossary entries for diffusion constants and heating metrics  

**Validation Script**  
- File: `theory/validation/P4_heating_models.py`  
- Purpose: Compare analytic heating predictions with stochastic simulation benchmarks
