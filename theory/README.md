# Theory Track

The theory track establishes the foundational physics for fly-by fingerprint detection, defining observables, approximations, and the interfaces other tracks consume.

## Current Focus
- Finalize baseline models for single-ion and chain dynamics.
- Draft acceptance criteria for collision observables and mitigation knobs.
- Maintain the shared glossary and cross-track reference points.
