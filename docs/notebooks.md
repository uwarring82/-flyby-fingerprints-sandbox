# Background Model Explorer

Launch the interactive Guardian background explorer directly in your browser using Binder. Voilà renders the same controls as an app-style dashboard.

## What to explore

- Adjust the laboratory environment temperature, mains pickup, and surface patch statistics to see their impact on Guardian null controls.
- Observe how the electromagnetic pickup power spectral density (PSD) and the surface drift Allan-like profile respond to each scenario.
- Watch the Guardian gate toggle between PASS and FAIL as null controls change and export the certificate snapshot for record keeping.
