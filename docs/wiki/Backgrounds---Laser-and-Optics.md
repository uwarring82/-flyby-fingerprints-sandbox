# Laser & Optics Channels

**What it is.** Laser intensity/pointing/frequency noise can couple through cooling and detection beams to produce excess motion or mask true fingerprints.

## How it shows up
- **Parametric-like drive** when beam interference or intensity noise modulates effective restoring forces near \(2\omega\).
- **Radiation-pressure fluctuations** add apparent diffusion and can bias Analog (A) scaling tests.

## Diagnostics
- Record **RIN** (relative intensity noise) spectra; compare with \(2\omega\) bands of trap modes.
- **Beam pointing** stability on trap; AOM/TA current noise checks.
- **Duty-cycle tests**: comparisons with beams shuttered versus on; off-resonant “dark” periods.

## Mitigations
- Intensity stabilization; low-RIN sources; fiber isolation; mechanical stability.
