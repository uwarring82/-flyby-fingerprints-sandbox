# Contributing

We welcome contributions (code, simulated datasets, documentation). All contributions are GPLv3.

## Guidelines
- Follow the CSV schema and clearly label simulated vs experimental data.
- Include minimal metadata (trap, species, geometry, pressure/temperature if relevant).
- Open a PR with a clear description; CI should pass.

## Community values
Honesty, openness, and reproducibility. This is publicly funded research; we share methods and results from day one. We use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT/Codex) in a hybrid, human-supervised workflow to ensure scientific integrity.
