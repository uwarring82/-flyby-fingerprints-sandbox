Enforce protective standards throughout the flyby-fingerprints project.

## Active Safety Requirements
1. Missing uncertainty quantification in physics modules
2. Residuals > 10% from canonical benchmarks
3. Incomplete documentation (incl. Failure Modes)
4. Failed validation tests or Guardian Gates

## Review Cadence
- Every PR: Automated checks via `guardian_gates.py`
- Weekly: Manual Guardian review of physics implementations
- Phase Gates: Comprehensive safety assessment and tri-stance sign-off

## Current Status
- Phase: Foundation (Week 1)
- Active Vetoes: None recorded
- Next Review: <set date>
