# flyby-fingerprints — Project Wiki

**Purpose.** This open, GPLv3 research program develops robust methods to identify *fingerprints of fly-by (residual-gas) collisions* in trapped-ion heating-rate measurements. We start with **simulated sandbox datasets** to validate the *Fast Triad (A–D–M)* screening and will later test on PAULA (lab “one-world” data). Longer-term, we invite other ion-trapping groups to contribute datasets under shared schemas.

**Approach (Fast Triad).**
- **Analog (A):** mode-resolved heating vs. frequency to test for impulsive admixtures beyond power-law backgrounds.
- **Digital (D):** burstiness and runs in interleaved binary trials (e.g., RSB/BSB).
- **Memory (M):** short-lag correlations in event-time streams (e.g., Ljung–Box, Allan variance).

**Principles.** Honesty, openness, reproducibility. All code and analyses are public from day one; derivatives remain open (GPLv3). We use modern tooling (e.g., ChatGPT/Codex) within a human-supervised, transparent workflow.
