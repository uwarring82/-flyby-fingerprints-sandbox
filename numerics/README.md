# Numerics Track

The numerics track delivers trustworthy simulations and computational tools that implement the theoretical interfaces and quantify uncertainties around fly-by fingerprints.

## Current Focus
- Build and benchmark integrators for trapped-ion motion with collision sources.
- Develop modular collision and decoherence kernels aligned with theory outputs.
- Automate convergence, regression, and CI checks for core simulators.
