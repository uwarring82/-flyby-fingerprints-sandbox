# Experiments Track

The experiments track captures procedures, calibrations, and data pathways that translate theoretical predictions into validated laboratory measurements of fly-by fingerprints.

## Current Focus
- Document baseline hardware configurations and environmental controls.
- Draft calibration and data-acquisition templates tied to theory observables.
- Coordinate validation runs that cross-check numerical predictions against lab diagnostics.
