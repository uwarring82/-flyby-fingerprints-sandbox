# üõ°Ô∏è Flyby Fingerprints: Simulation-First Collision Detection Framework

> **Critical Notice**  
> This project is **simulation-first**. Analysis of real data is **gated** by Guardian certification of the simulation + validation stack. PRs into `main` require the **Guardian Validation** CI check to pass.

![Guardian Validation](https://github.com/uwarring82/-flyby-fingerprints-sandbox/actions/workflows/guardian-validation.yml/badge.svg)

## üéØ Mission
Detect weak residual-gas collisions in trapped-ion systems via rigorously validated fingerprint analysis‚Äîstarting with a comprehensive simulation of all known background/systematic effects.

## üèóÔ∏è Three-Phase Architecture

- **Phase 1: Simulation Backend (ACTIVE) ‚úÖ**  
  Trapped-ion dynamics (target <0.1% deviation), Tier-1..3 background models, preliminary collision-injection API, Guardian validation framework (ROC, null testing).
- **Phase 2: Algorithm Development (GATED) üîó**  
  Requires certified Phase-1. A-D-M triad pipeline and Heptad analysis.
- **Phase 3: Real Data Analysis (GATED) üîó**  
  Requires certified Phase-2. Historical re-analysis, new campaigns, community portal.

> **GATED = dependent on prior certified phase.** Work may proceed on feature branches but **cannot merge to `main`** until certification passes.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Physicists
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uwarring82/-flyby-fingerprints-sandbox
cd flyby-fingerprints-sandbox
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m simulations.validation.guardian_gates  # if present
```

Algorithm Developers

```
# NOTE: Collision injection API is preliminary and may change pending backend completion.
from simulation_backend import api as sim
data, gt = sim.generate_background_only_with_markers()
# Implement your detector; compare to markers/gt.
```

| Module | Risk | Driver | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Physics Engine | Medium | Coulomb precision tuning requires HPC optimization | Schedule GPU acceleration sprint and validate results against analytic benchmarks |
| Background Effects | High | Tier-2 drift model lacks calibration data | Acquire calibration runs and extend Guardian synthetic suites |
| Collision Injection | High | Stable API contract pending validation feedback | Align API schema with validation framework and add integration tests |
| Validation Framework | Medium | ROC harness lacks null-hypothesis regression coverage | Expand null test suites and enforce Guardian thresholds in CI |

üõ°Ô∏è Guardian Requirements (merge gates)
‚Ä¢Physics deviation target: < 0.1% (tracked tests).
‚Ä¢Tier-1..3 backgrounds modeled with tests & bounds.
‚Ä¢Ground-truth preservation in I/O and APIs.
‚Ä¢ROC AUC > 0.95 at 10:1 SNR (sim suites).
‚Ä¢PRs ‚Üí CI Guardian Validation must pass.

Run `python scripts/guardian-cli.py --summary-json` for a local snapshot; add
`--strict` when pending checks should block merges instead of surfacing as
warnings.
