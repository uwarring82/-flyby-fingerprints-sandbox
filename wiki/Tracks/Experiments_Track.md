# Experiments Track

## Purpose & Outputs
- [ ] Encode procedures, calibration steps, and acquisition templates aligned with Guardian requirements.
- [ ] Characterize backgrounds before discovery claims.
- [ ] Provide lab-ready notebooks and data hooks for validation imports.
- Entry folder: [`experiments/`](../../tree/main/experiments/)

## Operating Stance
- Background-first: experiments currently support characterization and validation, **not** new discovery campaigns.
- Consume stable models from [Theory Track](Theory_Track) and numerical harnesses from [Numerics Track](Numerics_Track).
- Systematics references: see [Background Effects Catalog](../Background_Effects_Catalog).

## Uncertainty Budget Template
| Effect | Model ref | Cal param(s) | Expected magnitude | Data hook | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
