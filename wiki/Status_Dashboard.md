# Status Dashboard

- Canonical, always-up-to-date detail lives in [`STATUS.md`](../blob/main/STATUS.md). Refresh there before acting.

## Phase 1 Snapshot (Simulation Backend)
| Area | Owner | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Physics Engine | @uwarring82 | In Review (~60%) | Coulomb precision sweep; integrator selection. Target `<0.1%` deviation. |
| Background Effects | @uwarring82 | Active (~50%) | Thermal, EM, surface, detection models in progress. Next: RF PSD, drift metrics. |
| Collision Injection | @uwarring82 | Pending (~15%) | Schema + baseline tests queued. |
| Validation Framework | @uwarring82 | In Review (~40%) | Inventory check, null hypothesis, SNR≥10 stubs; ROC/AUC harness upcoming. |

## Guardian Gates (Phase-1 Exit)
- [ ] Background inventory complete (thermal, EM, surface, detection)
- [ ] Null controls pass (`p ≥ 0.05`)
- [ ] Claimed signatures meet `SNR ≥ 10`
- [ ] Physics deviation `< 0.1%`
- [ ] I/O preserves ground-truth metadata
