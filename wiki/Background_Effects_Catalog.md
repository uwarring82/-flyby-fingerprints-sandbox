# Background Effects Catalog

- Tier-1 through Tier-3 backgrounds must be modeled and validated **before** collision injection, matching the Guardian requirements documented in the README.
- Canonical catalog: [`docs/systematic_effects.md`](../blob/main/docs/systematic_effects.md). Update that file for full definitions; this page tracks ownership snapshots only.

## Ownership Snapshot
| Tier | Effect | Owner | Model file(s) | Validation data | Bound | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Add a New Effect Checklist
- [ ] Document model equations and parameters in [`docs/systematic_effects.md`](../blob/main/docs/systematic_effects.md).
- [ ] List calibration/fit parameters with expected bounds.
- [ ] Add a validation test or dataset reference (e.g., under [`notebooks/`](../tree/main/notebooks/) or [`data/`](../tree/main/data/)).
- [ ] Update the table above with owner, file links, and status.
