# Fly-by Fingerprints Wiki

> Ion–neutral collision signatures in trapped-ion systems: a sandbox to develop the theory, numerics, and experimental playbooks needed to detect and interpret fly-by events.

## Mission & Three-Phase Architecture
| Phase | Gate | Status | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 — Simulation Backend | Guardian gates met for background-first simulation | **ACTIVE** | [README ▸ Phases](../blob/main/README.md#roadmap--working-agreements) |
| Phase 2 — Algorithm Development | Requires validated Phase-1 interfaces | **GATED** | [README ▸ Roadmap](../blob/main/README.md#roadmap--working-agreements) |
| Phase 3 — Real Data Analysis | Requires Guardian-certified simulation & algorithms | **GATED** | [README ▸ Roadmap](../blob/main/README.md#roadmap--working-agreements) |

## Start Here
| Priority | Jump link | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⭐ | [Project Overview](Project_Overview) | Orientation on phases, tracks, and documentation map |
| 1 | [Theory Track](Tracks/Theory_Track) | Pillars, acceptance checklists, symbol glossary |
| 2 | [Status Dashboard](Status_Dashboard) | Human-readable summary → live STATUS.md |
| Quick utility | [Reporting Format](../blob/main/REPORTING.md) | Guardian-compliant progress/run notes |
